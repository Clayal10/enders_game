## Game Mechanics

### Fighting

#### Gaining Experience

In the battle school and on Eros, fighting is a method to gain experience. You will gain experience based off of who you fight, your current experience level, and how long it takes you to fight. For example, defeating Bean when you have 0 experience gives you more than when you're > 100. At the same time, fighting Bonzo at experience 1000 may give you the same experience as defeating Bean at 0.

#### Dying in Fights

Fights against the Formic Fleet or against the monsters on Earth will result in your death. Dying will mean you cannot create another character with that name for a TBD amount of time. Otherwise, leaving the game will allow you to rejoin as long as you use the exact same name or some other mechanic TBD.
